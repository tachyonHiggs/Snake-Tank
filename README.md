# Snake Tank

A temperature and humidity monitoring system primarly used for reptile terrariums. 

## Description

A small design that focuses on generally accurate temperature and humidity levels from mobile and long reaching sensors. 

## Design

It currently uses an ESP32-S3 breakout board along with two DHT11 sensors. The DHT11s where chosen for affordability and the need for general accuracy, not precesion.
An onboard LCD screen is used to check sensor readings at any time.
